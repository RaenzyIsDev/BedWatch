Join them, they have an AWESOME community. 

As usual, Drive (https://drive.google.com) will be a upload space. But I'll be dropping the finished product not just in releases, but in <green>Modrinth<green/> and, if I can figure out how, <orange>CurseForge!<orange/> I may also stream some bedwars content with <red>BedWatch.<red/>
